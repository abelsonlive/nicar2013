Practical machine learning in the newsroom
==========================================

Below we've included some software and code libraries you can use to get started with machine learning in the newsroom.

## Standalone software

- [Apache Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/) --
- [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) --
- [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) --

## Code libraries and other resources

Useful machine learning libraries have been implemented in most common languages, although their support and adoption varies. For the kind of smaller-scale
work you're likely to do in the newsroom, data scientists most often use Python and R.

### Python

- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (Python) --
- [NLTK](http://nltk.org/) (Python) --
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) (Python) --

### R

R has dozens of libraries to cover various machine learning functions, but some of the best are laid out here:

- [Machine Learning for Hackers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do) -- Also, [the code](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/ML_for_Hackers) is available on Github.

### Ruby
